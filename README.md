# Git Automation Test

This 'cloudbeesGitAutomationAssignment' repo contains the source code to automate these 2 test cases:
1. Given a git repo, clone it, add a new file with some content to this repo (file name and content should be an input)
2. Given a git repo, clone it, update an existing file by appending new content to this repo (file name and content should be an input)


## Assumptions

- Java 17+ is installed
- Git CLI is installed and available in system PATH
- Git credentials (via HTTPS or SSH) are already set up locally (cached or configured)
- The repo has:
  - At least one existing file named 'README.md'
  - Write access granted to the user executing this script
- Created Maven based Java project
- Used TestNG as a testing framework and Allure for reporting.
- Git Repo will only be cloned if the provided repo is not cloned already in the provided directory.
- Git Cloning operation will be skipped if directory already exists.

## How It Works

- Uses `ProcessBuilder` to invoke CLI git commands
- Test 1 clones the repo and adds a new file with content
- Test 2 appends content to an existing file
- Uses TestNG as the test framework
- added all the test cases of a class to be run in testng.xml to execute in one go

## Run Instructions

- Run 'mvn clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml' for executing all the test cases configured in testng.xml

## Allure Report

- Run 'mvn allure:report' command to generate the allure report after the test case results once testng.xml file is executed.
- This allure report will be generated t–æ directory: target/site/allure-maven/index.html
